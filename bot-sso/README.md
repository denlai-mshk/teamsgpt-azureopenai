# Build Bots for Teams

A bot, chatbot, or conversational bot is an app that responds to simple commands sent in chat and replies in meaningful ways. Examples of bots in everyday use include: bots that notify about build failures, bots that provide information about the weather or bus schedules, or provide travel information. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation. Being a cloud application, a bot can provide valuable and secure access to cloud services and corporate resources.

This is a sample chatbot application demonstrating Single Sign-on using `botbuilder` and Teams Framework that can respond to a `hello` message.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), supported versions: 14, 16, 18
- A Microsoft 365 account. If you do not have Microsoft 365 account, apply one from [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## Debug

Clone this repo, navigate to bot-sso/ folder. Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code. Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Start Debugging` green arrow button.

If you encounter the ngrok page below when sending the `show` command to the bot, please follow the steps to solve this issue.

1. Stop debugging in Visual Studio Code.
2. Sign up an ngrok account in https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup.
3. Copy your personal ngrok authtoken from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken.
4. Run `npx ngrok authtoken <your-personal-ngrok-authtoken>` in Visual Studio Code terminal.
5. Start debugging the project again by hitting the F5 key in Visual Studio Code.

## Add a SSO Command
- Follow the code in `bot-sso/bot/commands/showUserProfile.ts`, implemet `YourSSOCommand extends SSOCommand`
- Export `YourSSOCommand` in `commands/index.ts`
- You don't need to care about the details of SSO implements, the SSO process is in `bot-sso/helpers/ssoDialog.ts`, it will call `@microsoft/teamsfx` sdk to fetch SSO token, once got the token, it will call `YourSSOCommand.operationWithSSOToken`;

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams manifest in `templates/appPackage/manifest.template.json`. It contains template arguments with `{...}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:
